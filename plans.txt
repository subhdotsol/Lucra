OnChain arbitrage limitations ? 
- Searchers and validators can front-run transactions 
- Transactions ordering can be manipulated 
- Limited control over exectution timing 
- compute units limitations for complex calculations
- transaction size limits for mutli-hop trades 
- Higher latency compared to off chain 

For real world arbitrage ? 

- We need to monitor off chain and calculations
- Integrate with MEV aware infastructure to be safe from fast run
- Consider validator relationships for better transaction placement
- Implement proper slippage and risk management

// Things to manage : 
1. Slippage protection 
   - Dyamic calculations
   - max : 1%
2. Transaction monitoring
    - For tracking success rate 
    - Gas price optimization
    - Failed transaction
3. Sizing a position
    - based on liquidity available
